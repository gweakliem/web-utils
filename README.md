# Web Utilities project

I'm a Data Engineer in my day job and there's stuff I do all the time: convert unix timestamps, format some JSON to make it readable, base64 encode/decode stuff. There's a billion sites out there to do this but:

1. I wanted all that in one place
2. I wanted a project to work on
3. I wanted something I could deploy
4. I kinda wanted to do some front end work

All with a UI that only a backend engineer would come up with.

Deployed at https://meggie.be/
